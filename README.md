Hello! I am Sai Sujitha Kondapaneni, persuing my Bachlores in Koneru Lakshmaiah University, Andhra Pradesh. Although I am little good at coding I am completely new to developing. Working with Face Recognizing project was really terrible while i am woring on it, but now if I recall it was so much fun. I got a lot of help from my cousine cum senior in this project. She became my personal mentor till the end.
Coming to the working of the system, it is a stranger detection system. I provided a database of pictures of all sides of my face with my name. The database is used to detect the strangers. After running the code the Face_Recognizer the camera of your laptop starts and it detects the face with a box around it. Then it checks the database wheather the person is avaliable or not. If available it detects and displays the name of the person. If not it sends a telegram notification of the staranger's picture to your telegram account.
Please enter your telegram ID in the 126th line of Face_Recognizer code so that the stranger's picture will be sent to your telegram insterd of mine.
It was nice working with this project and it's an honor being in Microsoft Engage 2022 program.
Thank You!
